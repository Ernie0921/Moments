create 2 folder in directory 
client and server
client: run 'npx create-react-app ./'    you may need the latest node
server: create a index.js file then npm init 
server: install-
     body-parser (will allow us to do post req)
     cors (will enable cross origin request)
     express (routes)
     mongoose (to create model for our posts)
     nodemon (restart server when changes occurr)

index.js - you need to import or require the packages you installed
    import express from 'express'; 
    or
    const express = require('express);

    *newer node lets you use import instead of require just do the following modification in the package.json file
                            "main": "index.js",
                            "type": "module",
                            "scripts": {
                                "start": "nodemon index.js"
                            },
client: npm install-
    axios (make request)
    moment (working with time )
    react-file-base64 (to convert our images )
    redux
    redux-thunk( use to do asyncrounous actions using redux)
    @material-ui/core ( use for styling in react popular)
